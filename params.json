  "body": "# Introduction\r\nA java bot using JGraphT to learn language via Directed Weighted Graphs. It's meant to simulate neural networks and how they use connections between vertexes to reach complexer solutions. Originally this was a more ambitious project (with rules of grammar and a plethora of unused classes which now have been deleted) but now it functions on strings. \r\n\r\nThis was my final project for AP Computer Science.\r\n\r\n# Warning\r\nThis is a program that can take a while to load! Neural networks are super cool, but they're also memory intensive. I'm also still a beginning programmer so this may not be programmed in the most efficent way orz \r\n\r\n#Usage\r\nCurrently the amount of learning that I've taught the bot is avaliable, but if you want to start from scratch you can clone and delete dic.dot. \r\n\r\nYou can clone this and do whatever you want with it as long as you credit me. Preferably don't use this commercially.\r\n\r\n#Outside Sources\r\n\r\n## Used Libraries\r\nJGraphT - http://jgrapht.org/\r\n\r\n\"JGraphT is a free Java graph library that provides mathematical graph-theory objects and algorithms.\"\r\n\r\n## Used Data\r\n5000 Word Corpus - http://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp\r\n\r\nNon-case sensitive 2-Gram - http://www.ngrams.info/download_coca.asp\r\n\r\nThese were essential for even beginning to have something workable, thanks so much to the producers creating this free lists. However, due to licensing, I have NOT included this lists online. Please download the samples from their websites and put them in the primary folder for use. \r\n",
