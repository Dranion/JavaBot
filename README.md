# Introduction
A java bot using JGraphT to learn language via Directed Weighted Graphs. It's meant to simulate neural networks and how they use connections between vertexes to reach complexer solutions. Originally this was a more ambitious project (with rules of grammar and a plethora of unused classes which now have been deleted) but now it functions on strings. 

This was my final project for AP Computer Science.

# Warning
This is a program that can take a while to load! Neural networks are super cool, but they're also memory intensive. I'm also still a beginning programmer so this may not be programmed in the most efficent way orz 

#Usage
Currently the amount of learning that I've taught the bot is avaliable, but if you want to start from scratch you can clone and delete dic.dot. 

You can clone this and do whatever you want with it as long as you credit me. Preferably don't use this commercially.

These were essential for even beginning to have something workable, thanks so much to the producers creating this free lists.
